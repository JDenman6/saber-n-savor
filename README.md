# Saber and savor!

## Hello lovers of life!

I am a work in progress and currently in my infancy. When I grow up, I want to
be a community site for lovers of champagne, and especially for lovers of
sabering the necks of champagne bottles. Stay tuned for more real soon!

## Current status - Prototype 0
https://savory-saber-1799.herokuapp.com/
To get the project from Prototype 0 to Prototype 1, I'd like to add the
following features:
- [ ] The ability to sort users by name, created date, last active date, etc.
- [ ] Search for a specific user by name.
- [ ] Interest groups
  - Users can:
  - [ ] Search for a specific group and request to join it
  - [ ] Browse through public groups and join them
  - [ ] Create a new group
  - [ ] Admin and/or moderate groups
    - [ ] Set public vs private
    - [ ] Invite new members
    - [ ] Approve/Reject membership requests
    - [ ] Eject problem members
    - [ ] Edit / Delete problem posts 
- [ ] The ability to post videos instead of just pictures
